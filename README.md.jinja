## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Adding shadcn/ui Components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your project:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

This will place the UI components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Using Components

Import components from the `@workspace/ui` package:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button"
```

## Tailwind

Your `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` are already set up to use the components from the `ui` package.
